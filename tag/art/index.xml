      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the urbanization process in Hangzhou of China from 1978 to 2021 from the perspective of dual-track urbanization. The first track urbanization is sponsored by local government and state, and the second is a spontaneous track. This paper studies the relative roles of spontaneous and state-sponsored urbanization and their impacts on the spatial pattern, industrial structures, economic patterns, and characteristics of Hangzhou’s urbanization. It is found that government plays the leading role in urbanization, implementing policies on spatial structure, master plan, and economy. Spontaneous urbanization plays an important role in the process of urbanization, resulting in population migration, tertiary industry change, and economic innovation. Both tracks together guide Hangzhou’s urbanization into a pattern of its characteristics. The level of population urbanization is constantly improving; The development of urban and rural areas (spatial structure) is more coordinated; Remarkable achievements have been made in the construction of the digital economy, forming many strong private enterprises, characteristic towns, and development zones. The digital economy and private sectors have been booming since the 1990s, bring economic prosperity and urbanization. At this point, one could consider these as the distinguishing feature in Hangzhou’s urbanization, engendering the city’s modernization and urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hangzhou’s urbanization has entered a new stage. Thus, the study offers the following major policy implications for its urbanization. On the one hand, as Hangzhou’s economy is now evidently towards in “digital and intelligence”, the over-reliance on the tertiary industry increases the difficulties in boosting advanced manufacturing and urban modern agriculture. On the other hand, more migrant workers have chosen to stay in cities instead of going back to their hometowns. Under such circumstances, urban policies must be able to address the new challenges and promote a more sustainable pattern of urbanization, providing migrants with better-quality living conditions and institution safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research on race groups from a perspective of anthropology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The anti-racism movement brought the word &amp;ldquo;race&amp;rdquo; back to life and politics. However, how to define race and whether there is a clear definition between races are not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of anthropology, this paper explores the impact of the development of multi-regional evolution theory and molecular biology on racial division. This paper argues that gene exchange and fitness genetic variation make it unreliable to divide the human race only by skin color and region. In the context of multiculturalism, we should not give up modern genetics to explore the differences within and between the currently divided ethnic groups. We should rationally look at the overall differences in some aspects between the currently divided ethnic groups, understand the impact of environment, variation，and communication on genes, and correctly understand the individual diversity within the race&lt;/p&gt;
