The change is explained by land cover. The analysis results of temporal and spatial changes of soil moisture show that:\n From January 1999 to January 2019, the soil moisture in southern China has been at a high level for a long time, and the content is low only in 2008-2009 and 2012-2015, which may be affected by the dry season. From July of 1999 July 2019, there was an obvious regional distribution of soil moisture. The regional content in Southern China was high, the degree of soil moisture in Middle China was in the middle, and the soil moisture in Northern China was only about 40 degrees north latitude, which would reach 0.4 m3 / m3. After dividing the 21-year long time series into two stages: 1999-2009 and 2010-2019, it is found that the linear trend fitting between soil moisture and selected variables in each province is not ideal. Therefore, it is necessary to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the data before using the data set. In general, the soil moisture content in Northeast China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Yunnan fluctuated greatly with time and season. Among them, the soil in Yunnan has an obvious trend of aridity, which may be related to the reduction of soil moisture in the root zone caused by large-scale afforestation, such as the strong Western Pacific subtropical high in summer, the continuous strong Qinghai Tibet high, the weak southern branch in winter and the reduction of soil moisture in the root zone.  In this paper, representative provinces are selected to study the specific model of soil moisture evolution in detail, so as to provide support and suggestions for the application research of soil moisture change and ecological environment change in China. This research provides suggestions for the follow-up research which analyzes the temporal and spatial change of soil moisture using ESA CCI SM data.\nView Full Text (Simplifed Chinese)\n","date":1629172998,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629172998,"objectID":"51b501ae774731fe3b428d6149a9134a","permalink":"https://dreamerlyz.github.io/project/temporal-and-spatial-analysis-of-soil-moisture/","publishdate":"2021-08-17T12:03:18+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/temporal-and-spatial-analysis-of-soil-moisture/","section":"project","summary":"Aiming at the problems on soil moisture measurement in China, the European Space Agency climate change initiative (ESA CCI) was applied to analyze the temporal and spatial changes of soil moisture in the 1999-2019 in Jilin Province, Zhejiang Province, and Yunnan Province.","tags":["Science","Remote Sensing","Applied GIS","Hydrology"],"title":"Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Soil Moisture","type":"project"},{"authors":["LI Yizhen"],"categories":["Undergraduate"],"content":"This paper examines the urbanization process in Hangzhou of China from 1978 to 2021 from the perspective of dual-track urbanization. The first track urbanization is sponsored by local government and state, and the second is a spontaneous track. This paper studies the relative roles of spontaneous and state-sponsored urbanization and their impacts on the spatial pattern, industrial structures, economic patterns, and characteristics of Hangzhou’s urbanization. It is found that government plays the leading role in urbanization, implementing policies on spatial structure, master plan, and economy. Spontaneous urbanization plays an important role in the process of urbanization, resulting in population migration, tertiary industry change, and economic innovation. Both tracks together guide Hangzhou’s urbanization into a pattern of its characteristics. The level of population urbanization is constantly improving; The development of urban and rural areas (spatial structure) is more coordinated; Remarkable achievements have been made in the construction of the digital economy, forming many strong private enterprises, characteristic towns, and development zones. The digital economy and private sectors have been booming since the 1990s, bring economic prosperity and urbanization. At this point, one could consider these as the distinguishing feature in Hangzhou’s urbanization, engendering the city’s modernization and urbanization.\nHangzhou’s urbanization has entered a new stage. Thus, the study offers the following major policy implications for its urbanization. On the one hand, as Hangzhou’s economy is now evidently towards in “digital and intelligence”, the over-reliance on the tertiary industry increases the difficulties in boosting advanced manufacturing and urban modern agriculture. On the other hand, more migrant workers have chosen to stay in cities instead of going back to their hometowns. Under such circumstances, urban policies must be able to address the new challenges and promote a more sustainable pattern of urbanization, providing migrants with better-quality living conditions and institution safeguards.\nView Full Text\n","date":1629170542,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629170542,"objectID":"b5db321ea9c81ca48b591a354cda4c2d","permalink":"https://dreamerlyz.github.io/project/urbanization-in-hangzhou-of-china-1978-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-17T03:22:22.781Z","relpermalink":"/project/urbanization-in-hangzhou-of-china-1978-2021/","section":"project","summary":"This paper examines the urbanization process in Hangzhou of China from 1978 to 2021 from the perspective of dual-track urbanization.

This paper argues that gene exchange and fitness genetic variation make it unreliable to divide the human race only by skin color and region. In the context of multiculturalism, we should not give up modern genetics to explore the differences within and between the currently divided ethnic groups. We should rationally look at the overall differences in some aspects between the currently divided ethnic groups, understand the impact of environment, variation，and communication on genes, and correctly understand the individual diversity within the race\nView Full Text (Simplifed Chinese)\n","date":1629009105,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629009105,"objectID":"0891651a731ff1a391b426c8d24cee0d","permalink":"https://dreamerlyz.github.io/project/research-on-race-groups/","publishdate":"2021-08-15T06:31:45.339Z","relpermalink":"/project/research-on-race-groups/","section":"project","summary":"The anti-racism movement brought the word \"race\" back to life and politics.
